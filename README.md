Binterpret
=========

Binterpret is a little tool that interprets QR codes as pure binary data instead of other formats.
A black square is a one and a white square a zero. There is an argument that reverses it.
It was made as part of an Geocaching puzzle, but I figured it was a handy tool nonetheless.

Usage
======

```
âžœ  binterpret git:(master) python binterpret.py -h
usage: binterpret.py [-h] [-xblocks XBLOCKS] [-yblocks YBLOCKS]
                     [-offsetx OFFSETX] [-offsety OFFSETY] [-markx MARKX]
                     [-marky MARKY] [-marginx MARGINX] [-marginy MARGINY]
                     [--inverse] [--ascii] [--binary] [--gui]
                     filename
